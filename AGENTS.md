# Lead identification and resurfacing of story threads in archive

Using API under docs/infactory-openapi.json, then building system to identify threads and archive stories that should be resurfaced in new stories or content.

This is for internal use by journalists to identify how their current stories (if fed back as seed content) or evergreen (general watching of story stream) might link to the past, where you may resurface old stories and topics.

## Rules

- Always study spec/index.md
- If you work on a spec, you must update it accordingly
- New specs must be recorded in spec/index.md
